  abstract = {The formation of methylmercury (MeHg), which is biomagnified in aquatic food chains and poses a risk to human health, is effected by some iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria (FeRB and SRB) in anaerobic environments. However, very little is known regarding the mechanism of uptake of inorganic Hg by these organisms, in part because of the inherent difficulty in measuring the intracellular Hg concentration. By using the FeRB Geobacter sulfurreducens and the SRB Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 as model organisms, we demonstrate that Hg(II) uptake occurs by active transport. We also establish that Hg(II) uptake by G. sulfurreducens is highly dependent on the characteristics of the thiols that bind Hg(II) in the external medium, with some thiols promoting uptake and methylation and others inhibiting both. The Hg(II) uptake system of D. desulfuricans has a higher affinity than that of G. sulfurreducens and promotes Hg methylation in the presence of stronger complexing thiols. We observed a tight coupling between Hg methylation and MeHg export from the cell, suggesting that these two processes may serve to avoid the build up and toxicity of cellular Hg. Our results bring up the question of whether cellular Hg uptake is specific for Hg(II) or accidental, occurring via some essential metal importer. Our data also point at Hg(II) complexation by thiols as an important factor controlling Hg methylation in anaerobic environments.},

  abstract = {Bacterial resistance to inorganic and organic mercury compounds (HgR) is one of the most widely observed phenotypes in eubacteria. Loci conferring HgR in Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria typically have at minimum a mercuric reductase enzyme (MerA) that reduces reactive ionic Hg(II) to volatile, relatively inert, monoatomic Hg(0) vapor and a membrane-bound protein (MerT) for uptake of Hg(II) arranged in an operon under control of MerR, a novel metal-responsive regulator. Many HgR loci encode an additional enzyme, MerB, that degrades organomercurials by protonolysis, and one or more additional proteins apparently involved in transport. Genes conferring HgR occur on chromosomes, plasmids, and transposons and their operon arrangements can be quite diverse, frequently involving duplications of the above noted structural genes, several of which are modular themselves. How this very mobile and plastic suite of proteins protects host cells from this pervasive toxic metal, what roles it has in the biogeochemical cycling of Hg, and how it has been employed in ameliorating environmental contamination are the subjects of this review.},

Most notably, the latest research finds that microbes have a more direct impact on the transformation of oxidizable and reducible minerals than was previously believed. Following in the footsteps of its prior editions, Geomicrobiology, Fifth Edition serves as an introduction to this globally pertinent field and as an up-to-date reference reflecting recent groundbreaking advances.  Includes an Array of Detailed Illustrations Authored by two of the leading authorities in the field, this book illuminates the processes by which bacteria catalyze geomicrobial reactions. Generously laden with tables, graphics, diagrams, photographs, and illustrations, this all-encompassing reference examines the geomicrobial aspects of a wide range of minerals, including aluminum- and arsenic-containing minerals, and various fossil fuels.  Examines Geomicrobial Interactions with:  Silicon   Phosphorus   Nitrogen   Arsenic   Polonium   Plutonium   Manganese    Antimony   Chromium   Molybdenum   Vanadium   Uranium   Iron   One of life's great mysteries is how it sustains itself even in seemingly inhospitable environments, such as the deep subsurface. The authors anticipate that as mechanistic molecular approaches are increasingly applied to diverse problems in geomicrobiology, this and other fundamental puzzles will be resolved.},

Enrichment cultures prepared from contaminated sediments in the presence of 0.05 mM of mercury and under aerobic conditions allowed the isolation of five heterotrophic bacterial strains. 16S rDNA gene sequencing assigned the isolated strains to the genera Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter. For the first time mercury-resistant bacterial strains belonging to the genus Psychrobacter were evidenced. Minimum inhibitory concentrations in the presence of HgCl2 and of CH3HgCl showed high levels of resistance. EC50 values for the isolated bacterial strains in the presence of HgCl2 and of CH3HgCl confirmed the adaptation to the metal. Hg-resistant strains ORHg1, ORHg4 and ORHg5 showed the capacity to volatilize inorganic and organic mercury to elemental mercury, and formed biofilms on pumice particles, and were shown to play a role in the removal of mercury from sediment leachates. This study reports isolation and characterization of new Hg-resistant bacterial strains and provides novel insight into their possible use in bioremediation processes of mercury polluted sediments.},

A major environmental concern is the removal of boron from contaminated water and fly ash. For this purpose, the samples were collected from a fly ash dumping site, Nagasaki prefecture, Japan. The chemical characteristics and heavy metal concentration of the samples were performed by X-ray fluorescent analysis and leaching test. For bacterial analysis, samples were collected in sterile plastic sheets and isolation was carried out by serial dilution method. The boron tolerant isolates that showed values of maximum inhibitory concentration toward boron ranging from 100 to 260 mM level were screened. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates were most closely related to the genera Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, Microbacterium and Ralstonia. The boron tolerance of these strains was also associated with resistant to several heavy metals, such as As (III), Cr (VI), Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, Se (III) and Zn. Indeed, these strains were arsenic oxidizing bacteria confirmed by silver nitrate test. These strains exhibited their salt resistances ranging from 4 to 15 \% were determined in Trypticase soy agar medium. The boron tolerant strains were capable of removing 0.1\textendash{}2.0 and 2.7\textendash{}3.7 mg l-1 boron from the medium and fly ash at 168 h.

  abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affects human and ecosystem health. We synthesize understanding of sources, atmosphere-land-ocean Hg dynamics and health effects, and consider the implications of Hg-control policies. Primary anthropogenic Hg emissions greatly exceed natural geogenic sources, resulting in increases in Hg reservoirs and subsequent secondary Hg emissions that facilitate its global distribution. The ultimate fate of emitted Hg is primarily recalcitrant soil pools and deep ocean waters and sediments. Transfers of Hg emissions to largely unavailable reservoirs occur over the time scale of centuries, and are primarily mediated through atmospheric exchanges of wet/dry deposition and evasion from vegetation, soil organic matter and ocean surfaces. A key link between inorganic Hg inputs and exposure of humans and wildlife is the net production of methylmercury, which occurs mainly in reducing zones in freshwater, terrestrial, and coastal environments, and the subsurface ocean. Elevated human exposure to methylmercury primarily results from consumption of estuarine and marine fish. Developing fetuses are most at risk from this neurotoxin but health effects of highly exposed populations and wildlife are also a concern. Integration of Hg science with national and international policy efforts is needed to target efforts and evaluate efficacy.},

We found that bacterioplankton collected in ASB discharges were significantly more tolerant to metal and antibiotic exposures than bacterioplankton collected in ASB intakes. Optical properties of microorganisms collected in ASB discharges indicated no defensive physiological adaptations such as formation of resting stages or excessive production of exopolymers. Thus, it is likely that the elevated frequency of metal and antibiotic tolerances in bacterioplankton in ASB discharges were caused by shifts in microbial community composition, resulting from the selective pressure imposed by elevated metal concentrations or organic toxicants present in ASBs.},

  abstract = {Mercuric mercury (Hg[II]) is a highly toxic and mobile element that is likely to have had a pronounced and adverse effect on biology since Earth's oxygenation {$\sim$}2.4 billion years ago due to its high affinity for protein sulfhydryl groups, which upon binding destabilize protein structure and decrease enzyme activity, resulting in a decreased organismal fitness. The central enzyme in the microbial mercury detoxification system is the mercuric reductase (MerA) protein, which catalyzes the reduction of Hg(II) to volatile Hg(0). In addition to MerA, mer operons encode for proteins involved in regulation, Hg binding, and organomercury degradation. Mer-mediated approaches have had broad applications in the bioremediation of mercury-contaminated environments and industrial waste streams. Here, we examine the composition of 272 individual mer operons and quantitatively map the distribution of mer-encoded functions on both taxonomic SSU rRNA gene and MerA phylogenies. The results indicate an origin and early evolution of MerA among thermophilic bacteria and an overall increase in the complexity of mer operons through evolutionary time, suggesting continual gene recruitment and evolution leading to an improved efficiency and functional potential of the Mer detoxification system. Consistent with a positive relationship between the evolutionary history and topology of MerA and SSU rRNA gene phylogenies (Mantel R = 0.81, p {$<$} 0.01), the distribution of the majority of mer functions, when mapped on these phylograms, indicates an overall tendency to inherit mer-encoded functions through vertical descent. However, individual mer functions display evidence of a variable degree of vertical inheritance, with several genes exhibiting strong evidence for acquisition via lateral gene transfer and/or gene loss. Collectively, these data suggest that (i) mer has evolved from a simple system in geothermal environments to a widely distributed and more complex and efficient detoxification system, and (ii) merA is a suitable biomarker for examining the functional diversity of Hg detoxification and for predicting the composition of mer operons in natural environments.},

Tolerance to Cr was observed mainly in Gram positive bacteria while in the case of Ag and Hg the tolerant bacteria were predominately Gram negative. Hg was the metal for which the percentage of tolerance was significantly higher, especially in samples from the hospital sewage (4.1\%). Mercury also had the most discernible effect on color of the colonies. Considering the effect of metals on the respiratory enzymes, one strain of Ag-tolerant Bacillus sp. and one of Hg-tolerant P. aeruginosa were unable to produce oxidase in the presence of Ag and Hg, respectively, while the expression of gelatinase was largely inhibited in various Gram negative strains (66\% by Cr). Drug resistance in Hg-tolerant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the university hospital sewage was greater than 80\%, with prevalence of multiple resistance, while the Ag-tolerant strains from the same source showed about 34\% of resistance, with the predominance of mono-resistance. Our results showed that, despite the ability of metal tolerant strains to survive and grow in the presence of these elements, the interactions with these metals may result in metabolic or phisiological changes in this group of bacteria.},

Hence, marine bacteria can be used more efficiently than their terrestrial counterparts for enhanced bioremediation of mercury in contaminated envi-ronments.},

  abstract = {Mine water is an example of an extreme environment that contains a large number of diverse and specific bacteria. It is imperative to gain an understanding of these bacterial communities in order to develop effective strategies for the bioremediation of polluted aquatic systems. In this study, the high-throughput sequencing approach was used to characterize the bacterial communities in two different mine waters of South Africa: vanadium and gold mine water. Over 2629 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were recovered from 15,802 reads of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. They represented 8 phyla, 43 orders, 84 families and 105 genera. Proteobacteria and unclassified bacterial sequences were the most dominant. Apart from these, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Candidate phylum OD1, Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Deinococcus-Thermus were the recovered phyla, although their relative abundance differed between both the mine-water samples. Yet, diversity indices suggested that the bacterial communities inhabiting the vanadium mine water were more diverse than those in gold mine water. Interestingly, substantial percentages of the reads from either sample (58 \% in vanadium and 17 \% in gold mine water) could not be assigned to any phylum and remained unclassified, suggesting hitherto unidentified populations, and vast untapped microbial diversity. Overall, the results of this study exhibited bacterial community structures with high diversity in mine water, which can be explored further for their role in bioremediation and environmental management.},

  abstract = {On December 22, 2008 a dike containing coal fly ash from the Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Fossil Plant near Kingston Tennessee USA failed and resulted in the largest coal ash spill in U.S. history. Coal ash, a by-product of coal combustion, is known to contain multiple contaminants of concern, including arsenic and selenium. The purpose of this study was to investigate species differences in the bioaccumulation of arsenic and selenium and potential factors contributing to these differences (i.e., trophic dynamics and gut pH) in the vicinity of the Kingston coal ash spill. Elevated levels of arsenic and selenium were observed in various tissues of largemouth bass, white crappie, bluegill and redear sunfish from sites associated with the Kingston coal ash spill. Highest concentrations of selenium were found in redear sunfish with liver concentrations as high as 24.83mg/kg dry weight and ovary concentrations up to 10.40mg/kg dry weight at coal ash-associated sites. Investigations into the gut pH and trophic dynamics of redear sunfish and bluegill demonstrated a large difference in the gut physiology between these two species. Redear sunfish stomach and intestinal pH was found to be 1.1 and 0.16 pH units higher than in bluegill, respectively. In addition, fish from coal ash-associated sites showed enrichment differences (15N and 13C) compared to no ash sites, indicating differences in food web dynamics between sites. These results imply the incorporation of coal ash-associated compounds into local food webs and/or a shift in diet at ash sites compared to the no ash reference sites. Based on these results, further investigation into a broader food web at ash-associated sites is warranted.},

  volume = {145},
  issn = {0301-4797},
  abstract = {Coal fly ash (CFA), a by-product of coal combustion has been regarded as a problematic solid waste, mainly due to its potentially toxic trace elements, PTEs (e.g. Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb) and organic compounds (e.g. PCBs, PAHs) content. However, CFA is a useful source of essential plant nutrients (e.g. Ca, Mg, K, P, S, B, Fe, Cu and Zn). Uncontrolled land disposal of CFA is likely to cause undesirable changes in soil conditions, including contamination with PTEs, PAHs and PCBs. Prudent CFA land application offers considerable opportunities, particularly for nutrient supplementation, pH correction and ameliorating soil physical conditions (soil compaction, water retention and drainage). Since CFA contains little or no N and organic carbon, and CFA-borne P is not readily plant available, a mixture of CFA and manure or sewage sludge (SS) is better suited than CFA alone. Additionally, land application of such a mixture can mitigate the mobility of SS-borne PTEs, which is known to increase following cessation of SS application. Research analysis further shows that application of alkaline CFA with or without other amendments can help remediate at least marginally metal contaminated soils by immobilisation of mobile metal forms.

CFA land application with SS or other source of organic carbon, N and P can help effectively reclaim/restore mining-affected lands. Given the variability in the nature and composition of CFA (pH, macro- and micro-nutrients) and that of soil (pH, texture and fertility), the choice of CFA (acidic or alkaline and its application rate) needs to consider the properties and problems of the soil. CFA can also be used as a low cost sorbent for the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from wastewater streams; the disposal of spent CFA however can pose further challenges.

Problems in CFA use as a soil amendment occur when it results in undesirable change in soil pH, imbalance in nutrient supply, boron toxicity in plants, excess supply of sulphate and PTEs. These problems, however, are usually associated with excess or inappropriate CFA applications. The levels of PAHs and PCBs in CFA are generally low; their effects on soil biota, uptake by plants and soil persistence, however, need to be assessed. In spite of this, co-application of CFA with manure or SS to land enhances its effectiveness in soil improvements.},

  abstract = {The Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston coal ash spill in December 2008 deposited approximately 4.1 million m3 of fly ash and bottom ash into the Emory and Clinch River system (Harriman, Tennessee, U.S.A.). The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the ash on surface water and sediment quality over an eighteen month period after the spill, with a specific focus on mercury and methylmercury in sediments. Our results indicated that surface water quality was not impaired with respect to total mercury concentrations. However, in the sediments of the Emory River near the coal ash spill, total mercury concentrations were 3- to 4-times greater than sediments several miles upstream of the ash spill. Similarly, methylmercury content in the Emory and Clinch River sediments near the ash spill were slightly elevated (up to a factor of 3) at certain locations compared to upstream sediments. Up to 2\% of the total mercury in sediments containing coal ash was present as methylmercury. Mercury isotope composition and sediment geochemical data suggested that elevated methylmercury concentrations occurred in regions where native sediments were mixed with coal ash (e.g., less than 28\% as coal ash in the Emory River). This coal ash may have provided substrates (such as sulfate) that stimulated biomethylation of mercury. The production of methylmercury in these areas is a concern because this neurotoxic organomercury compound can be highly bioaccumulative. Future risk assessments of coal ash spills should consider not only the leaching potential of mercury from the wastes but also the potential for methylmercury production in receiving waters.},

  abstract = {Two genes, hgcA and hgcB, are essential for microbial mercury (Hg) methylation. Detection and estimation of their abundance, in conjunction with Hg concentration, bioavailability, and biogeochemistry, are critical in determining potential hot spots of methylmercury (MeHg) generation in at-risk environments. We developed broad-range degenerate PCR primers spanning known hgcAB genes to determine the presence of both genes in diverse environments. These primers were tested against an extensive set of pure cultures with published genomes, including 13 Deltaproteobacteria, nine Firmicutes, and nine methanogenic Archaea genomes. A distinct PCR product at the expected size was confirmed for all hgcAB+ strains tested via Sanger sequencing. Additionally, we developed clade-specific degenerate quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers that targeted hgcA for each of the three dominant Hg-methylating clades. The clade-specific qPCR primers amplified hgcA from 64\%, 88\%, and 86\% of tested pure cultures of Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Archaea, respectively, and were highly specific for each clade. Amplification efficiencies and detection limits were quantified for each organism. Primer sensitivity varied among species based on sequence conservation. Finally, to begin to evaluate the utility of our primer sets in nature, we tested hgcA and hgcAB recovery from pure cultures spiked into sand and soil. These novel quantitative molecular tools designed in this study will allow for more accurate identification and quantification of the individual Hg-methylating groups of microorganisms in the environment. The resulting data will be essential in developing accurate and robust predictive models of Hg methylation potential, ideally integrating the geochemistry of Hg methylation to the microbiology and genetics of hgcAB.
IMPORTANCE The neurotoxin methylmercury (MeHg) poses a serious risk to human health. MeHg production in nature is associated with anaerobic microorganisms. The recent discovery of the Hg-methylating gene pair, hgcA and hgcB, has allowed us to design and optimize molecular probes against these genes within the genomic DNA for microorganisms known to methylate Hg. The protocols designed in this study allow for both qualitative and quantitative assessments of pure-culture or environmental samples. With these protocols in hand, we can begin to study the distribution of Hg-methylating organisms in nature via a cultivation-independent strategy.},

  abstract = {Advances have been made recently in assessing accumulation and effects of coal combustion residues (CCR). I provide a brief review of recent advancements, provide a tabulated summary of results of recent work, and put forth recommendations for future studies. One advancement is that mercury accumulation has begun to receive (limited) attention, whereas it had rarely been considered in the past. Additionally, some constituents of CCR have been shown to be accumulated by adults and transferred to offspring, sometimes compromising offspring health. Studies have demonstrated that amphibians, possessing complex life cycles, may accumulate and transfer some contaminants to terrestrial systems. Some study has been given to molecular and cellular effects of CCR exposure, although these studies have been limited to invertebrates. Population models have also been applied to CCR affected systems and have shown that CCR may affect animal populations under some conditions. In light of these advancements, there are several topics that require further assessment. First, more attention to Hg and its dynamics in CCR affected systems is warranted. Hg can be highly accumulative and toxic under some conditions and may interact with other components of CCR (notably Se), perhaps altering accumulation and effects of the contaminant mixtures. Second, further investigation of maternal transfer and effects of CCR contaminants need to be conducted. These studies could benefit from incorporation of quantitative models to project impacts on populations. Finally, more attention to the organic constituents of CCR (PAHs) is required, as a focus on inorganic compounds only may restrict our knowledge of contaminant dynamics and effects as a whole. While further studies will shed light on some chemical and biological nuances of exposure and effect, information available to date from numerous study sites implicates CCR as a bulk effluent that presents risks of bioaccumulation and effects on organisms in aquatic systems.},

A significant positive correlation was observed between hgcA gene abundance and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations, suggesting that microbes containing the genes contribute to Hg methylation in the sampled soils. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the hgcA gene diversity in microbial community structures from paddy soils was high and was influenced by the contents of total Hg, SO42-, NH4+, and organic matter. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hgcA microbes in the sampled soils likely were related to Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, and two unclassified groups.

It is produced by bacteria in soils and sediments that have been contaminated with mercury. To explore the potential of plants to extract and detoxify this chemical, we engineered a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to express a modified bacterial gene, merBpe, encoding organomercurial lyase (MerB) under control of a plant promoter. MerB catalyzes the protonolysis of the carbon\textemdash{}mercury bond, removing the organic ligand and releasing Hg(II), a less mobile mercury species. Transgenic plants expressing merBpe grew vigorously on a wide range of concentrations of monomethylmercuric chloride and phenylmercuric acetate. Plants lacking the merBpe gene were severely inhibited or died at the same organomercurial concentrations. Six independently isolated transgenic lines produced merBpe mRNA and MerB protein at levels that varied over a 10- to 15-fold range, and even the lowest levels of merBpe expression conferred resistance to organomercurials. Our work suggests that native macrophytes (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses) engineered to express merBpe may be used to degrade methylmercury at polluted sites and sequester Hg(II) for later removal.},

  abstract = {The effects of coal ash (differing in age by the time of disposal) on the abundance of soil microorganisms, dehydrogenase activity and soil respiration were assessed. Samples of sluiced and cyclone-bottom ash from two abandoned sites, and one sluiced-ash site, currently in use, were collected at the Savannah River Site in Barnwell County, S.C. Soil samples collected near the ash basins were used as a control. There were significant differences by location in the estimates of actinomycetes, culturable bacteria, fungi, amylolytic organisms, and nitrifying, denitrifying and selenate-reducing bacteria. In general, higher estimates of actinomycetes, bacteria, fungi, amylolytic organisms and denitrifying bacteria were obtained from the abandoned sluiced-ash basin. The estimates of nitrifying and selenate-reducing bacteria were highest in the new ash basin currently in use. Microbial populations were correlated with pH, \% total C, or \% total N. Most of the correlations were associated with total N. Microbial diversity indices (phyleal and physiological) were determined to be low (\&lt; 1.0) for all locations. However, phyleal diversity indices also correlated with \% total N. Increases in dehydrogenase activity and soil respiration were observed when ash or soil samples were treated with glucose or glucose plus ammonium nitrate, indicating that the availability of simple organic compounds and N are limiting factors for microbial activity. Cumulative CO2 evolution indicated that a priming effect occurred by day 15 of incubation after glucose or glucose plus ammonium nitrate had been applied. The results suggest that the abundance, diversity and activity of microorganisms increase as the ash basin ages. The land-disposal of fly ash will require the addition of low C:N ratio residues to stimulate microbial community development.},

  abstract = {Photodegradation is an important sink for highly toxic methylmercury (MeHg) in aquatic ecosystems. Lakes have been extensively studied for MeHg photodegradation, but much less is known about streams, mainly because of the heterogeneity in sunlight availability along stream reaches and because there has been a lack of tools with which to integrate this longitudinal variability. We utilize odd-mass anomalies of stable Hg isotopes (i.e., {$\Delta$}199Hg) as a proxy for estimating the relative extent of MeHg photodegradation in streams. In a northern California stream network, levels of MeHg in water and biota increased with increasing stream size in headwater and intermediate streams (drainage areas ranging from 0.6 to 150 km2), but MeHg levels decreased substantially in larger streams (drainage areas up to 1212 km2). In smaller streams, the increase of MeHg levels is attributed to increasing in situ MeHg production and is accompanied by only a small increase in {$\Delta$}199Hg, indicating that the rate of MeHg photodegradation is low relative to the rate of in situ MeHg production. In larger streams, decreasing MeHg levels coincided with significant increases in {$\Delta$}199Hg of MeHg (an average increase of 1.5\textperthousand{} {$\pm$} 0.5\textperthousand, n  =  4), indicating that increasing MeHg photodegradation reduced MeHg levels in these wider, more open channels. Our findings clearly indicate that increasing sunlight availability in stream channels substantially increases MeHg photodegradation, which can reduce MeHg contamination in stream food webs.},

  volume = {18},

  abstract = {Mercury (Hg) associated with coal ash is an environmental concern, particularly if the release of coal ash to the environment is associated with the conversion of inorganic Hg to methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative form of Hg that is produced by anaerobic microorganisms. In this study, sediment slurry microcosm experiments were performed to understand how spilled coal ash might influence MeHg production in anaerobic sediments of an aquatic ecosystem. Two coal ash types were used: (1) a weathered coal ash; and (2) a freshly collected, unweathered fly ash that was relatively enriched in sulfate and Hg compared to the weathered ash. These ash samples were added to anaerobic sediment slurries constructed with a relatively pristine sediment (containing 0.03 mg kg(-1) Hg) and a Hg-contaminated sediment (containing 0.29 mg kg(-1) Hg). The results of these experiments showed negligible net production of MeHg in microcosms with no ash and in microcosms amended with the low sulfate/low Hg ash. In contrast, slurry microcosms amended with high sulfate/high Hg ash showed increases in total MeHg content that was 2 to 3 times greater than control microcosms without ash (p {$<$} 0.001). 16S amplicon sequencing of microbial communities in the slurries indicated that the coal ash addition generally increased the relative abundance of the methylating microbial community, including sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-reducing bacteria species that are known to be efficient methylators of Hg. The stimulation of these microorganisms was likely caused by the release of substrates (sulfate and Fe) originating from the ash. Overall, the results highlight the need to incorporate both environmental parameters and coal ash characteristics into risk assessments that guide coal ash management and disposal.},

  abstract = {An 18 month investigation of the environmental impacts of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) coal ash spill in Kingston, Tennessee combined with leaching experiments on the spilled TVA coal ash have revealed that leachable coal ash contaminants (LCACs), particularly arsenic, selenium, boron, strontium, and barium, have different effects on the quality of impacted environments. While LCACs levels in the downstream river water are relatively low and below the EPA drinking water and ecological thresholds, elevated levels were found in surface water with restricted water exchange and in pore water extracted from the river sediments downstream from the spill. The high concentration of arsenic (up to 2000 {$\mu$}g/L) is associated with some degree of anoxic conditions and predominance of the reduced arsenic species (arsenite) in the pore waters. Laboratory leaching simulations show that the pH and ash/water ratio control the LCACs' abundance and geochemical composition of the impacted water. These results have important implications for the prediction of the fate and migration of LCACs in the environment, particularly for the storage of coal combustion residues (CCRs) in holding ponds and landfills, and any potential CCRs effluents leakage into lakes, rivers, and other aquatic systems.},

First the surface release of coal ash with high levels of toxic elements (As = 75 mg/kg; Hg = 150 microg/kg) and radioactivity (226Ra + 228Ra = 8 pCi/g) to the environment has the potential to generate resuspended ambient fine particles ({$<$} 10 microm) containing these toxics into the atmosphere that may pose a health risk to local communities. Second, leaching of contaminants from the coal ash caused contamination of surface waters in areas of restricted water exchange, but only trace levels were found in the downstream Emory and Clinch Rivers due to river dilution. Third, the accumulation of Hg- and As-rich coal ash in river sediments has the potential to have an impact on the ecological system in the downstream rivers by fish poisoning and methylmercury formation in anaerobic river sediments.},

The dsrB-DGGE method revealed considerable genetic diversity when applied to DNA extracts obtained from aquifer samples that were derived from monitoring wells of an in situ metal precipitation (ISMP) pilot project conducted at the site of a non-ferrous industry or from environmental heavy metal contaminated samples. The sequences of the excised and sequenced DGGE bands represented dsrB genes of different SRB-subgroups,-genera and -species, thus confirming the broad applicability of the PCR primer pair. Linking the results of the physico-chemical follow-up of the field and lab experiments to the dsrB-DGGE data will provide a better understanding of the contribution of the SRB populations to the ongoing ISMP processes.},

Here, we report the results of comparative sequence analysis of dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DSR) genes from closely and distantly related sulfate-reducing organisms to infer the evolutionary history of DSR. A 1.9-kb DNA region encoding most of the alpha and beta subunits of DSR could be recovered only from organisms capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction with a PCR primer set targeting highly conserved regions in these genes. All DNA sequences obtained were highly similar to one another (49 to 89\% identity), and their inferred evolutionary relationships were nearly identical to those inferred on the basis of 16S rRNA. We conclude that the high similarity of bacterial and archaeal DSRs reflects their common origin from a conserved DSR. This ancestral DSR was either present before the split between the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya or laterally transferred between Bacteria and Archaea soon after domain divergence. Thus, if the physiological role of the DSR was constant over time, then early ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea already possessed a key enzyme of sulfate and sulfite respiration.},

Strain V1 cultures readily degraded methylmercury, thimerosal, phenylmercury acetate, and reduced mercuric chloride into gaseous Hg(0). However, the Hg transformation in LB broth by P. putida V1 was influenced by the type of Hg compounds. The merA gene was detected in P. putida V1, on the other hand, the merB gene was not detected. The sequencing of this gene, showed high similarity (100\%) to the mercuric reductase gene of other Pseudomonas spp. Furthermore, tests using radioactive (14)C-methylmercury indicated an uncommon release of (14)CO2 concomitant with the production of Hg(0). The results of the present work suggest that P. putida V1 has the potential to remove methylmercury from contaminated sites. More studies are warranted to determine the mechanism of removal of methylmercury by P. putida V1.},

The genome of Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1, which was originally isolated from soil at an atrazine spill site, is composed of a single 4,597,686 basepair (bp) circular chromosome and two circular plasmids, pTC1 and pTC2, which are 408,237 bp and 300,725 bp, respectively. Over 66\% of the 4,702 open reading frames (ORFs) present in the TC1 genome could be assigned a putative function, and 13.2\% (623 genes) appear to be unique to this bacterium, suggesting niche specialization. The genome of TC1 is most similar to that of Tropheryma, Leifsonia, Streptomyces, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, and analyses suggest that A. aurescens TC1 has expanded its metabolic abilities by relying on the duplication of catabolic genes and by funneling metabolic intermediates generated by plasmid-borne genes to chromosomally encoded pathways. The data presented here suggest that Arthrobacter's environmental prevalence may be due to its ability to survive under stressful conditions induced by starvation, ionizing radiation, oxygen radicals, and toxic chemicals.},

  abstract = {Mobilization of heavy metals around coal power plants due to improper disposal of fly ash (FA) and wastewater have led to release of pollutants into the environment. For protection of inimitable natural resources, application of economical and effective technologies is needed such as phytoremediation is cost-effective, ecofriendly and a better option for elimination of metal from contaminated sites. Twelve plant species were sampled from ash dyke of Singrauli and screened for accumulation of metals for this study. Mobilization ratio of metals from soil to plant was evaluated to determine translocation factor. CILLAS analyzer, Raman spectroscopy and SEM-EDX were used for characterization of particle size, functional groups and morphology of fly ash. Results showed mean metal concentrations in contaminated soil for Fe, Mn, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb were 909.4, 60.6, 9.5, 134.8, 13.6, 26.7, 2.9 and 25.4 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}g g-1 respectively. Enrichment factors for soil, root and shoot for a contaminated site were 1.9, 3.8 \& 4.3 for Zn and 2.7, 3.5 \& 3.8 for Cd. Six hyper-accumulators with absorption efficiency {$>$}1 viz. I. carnea, S. nigrum, S. munja, T. angustifolia, C. dactylon and P. hysterophorus were identified which may be cultivated successively to reclaim and restore damaged agricultural land.},

Volatilization of Hg2+ from aqueous solutions could be prevented by any of the growth media or their components. All media bound large amounts of Hg2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+, but much less Cd2+. Of the media components, casamino acids showed the most binding activity for all metal ions; the relative affinity of other media components to different ions varied with the cation studied. In general, the Irving-Williams [8] series for cation affinity to organic ligands was followed: Hg2+{$>$}Pa2+{$\gg$} Cu2+{$\gg$} Cd2+.After adding 20 ppm of Hg2+, Pb2+, or Cu2+ (concentrations inhibitory to the growth of most microorganisms) to the growth media, 80 ppb or less remained as free cations in the solution. This might suggest that such ions enter bacterial cells as organic complexes, or that bacterial cells can compete successfully with growth media for the bound ions.},

@article{hughesMetalSpeciationMicrobial1991,
  title = {Metal Speciation and Microbial Growth-the Hard (and Soft) Facts},
  volume = {137},
  abstract = {Micro-organisms require certain metallic elements for growth and function (Hughes \& Poole, 1989). These include, for example, the bulk elements potassium and magnesium, and trace elements such as manganese, iron, copper, zinc and molybdenum. Essential metals are shown in Fig. 1, the Periodic Table. The need for these essential metals is, or should be, acknowledged in the composition of growth media. However, higher concentrations of these metals, and the heavy metals such as silver, cadmium, mercury, tin and lead (Fig. l), may be toxic. In any study of the biological effects of either essential or toxic metals it is imperative that full account be taken of the speciation or chemical form(s) of the metal ion in the growth medium, in the organisms' environment, and in experimental media such as buffers; the bioavailability, and hence reactivity, of the metal is critically dependent upon its speciation (Bernhard et al., 1986; Morrison et al., 1989). Unfortunately it appears that little attention is sometimes given to these matters, and that this has led to some invalid and misleading conclusions in the microbiological literature. In this review it is intended to survey the factors that control the speciation of metal ions in media, to summarize methods for establishing the speciation of metal ions in solution and to suggest some simple guidelines for estimating the bioavailability of metal ions in media. Some commonly-used media will be assessed in the light of these comments and attention drawn to errors that have resulted from a failure to recognize the importance of metal speciation. A recent and topical example will serve to illustrate the importance of speciation effects and the ease with which they are overlooked. It has been suggested in both the scientific and popular press that levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide could be reduced by `sowing' the ocean with tons of iron filings to boost growth of marine algae (Davies, 1990; Martin et al., 1990). Little mention has been made of the problems of maintaining the iron in a form which is bioavailable. Significantly, Hutner (1972) cites much earlier work, which demonstrated that the 725},

@techreport{hersheyHeavyMetalAnalysis2016,
  title = {Heavy Metal Analysis, Gene Proxies, and Stable Isotope Tracers of Coal Ash Contamination in the Dan River Food Web},
  abstract = {The goals of the project were to trace the extent of mercury (Hg) contamination in the Dan River food web and food web disruption derived from the coal ash spill, evaluate microbial pathways governing coal ash contaminant routing to the food web, and evaluate the extent to which stable isotope of sulfur could be used to trace coal ash contamination in food webs. Approaches for meeting the goals included analysis of coal ash Hg concentrations in river sediments and food web components at multiple sites upstream and downstream of the spill; using multiple stable isotopes to evaluate food web disruption and quantify the portion of the contamination that is attributable to the spill; and using gene proxies to assess the microbial mechanisms that route coal ash metals into the food web. Of four objectives, objectives (1) and (2) of the proposed work addressed the research question: How much metal contamination and food web disruption has occurred in the Dan River food web due to the February 2014 coal ash spill? Objectives (3) and (4) addressed the research question: How well do gene proxies for microbes that chelate metals or methylate Hg predict coal-Ash derived heavy metals in the Dan River food web? The approaches used can readily be applied to long term Dan River monitoring or to other coal ash spill sites. Our results are still preliminary and additional analyses are pending. We did observe some patterns that indicate negative effects of the coal ash spill: Elevated Hg in downstream samples that was above the baseline attributable to organic matter content, and incorporation of coal ash derived sulfur into riparian spiders that feed on emerging insects. To date we do not see a signal of microbial response that can be conclusively attributable to coal ash spill, and further study will be needed to more fully evaluate those effects. Thus, although we have not seen an alarming coal ash effect to date on the microbial community, and impacts on invertebrate components of the food web were limited to spiders, further investigation is needed to evaluate Hg methylation over time as well as persistence of the coal ash Hg in river sediments.},

  title = {Impacts of Coal Ash on Methylmercury Production and the Methylating Microbial Community in Anaerobic Sediment Slurries},
  volume = {18},
  issn = {2050-7895},
  abstract = {Mercury (Hg) associated with coal ash is an environmental concern, particularly if the release of coal ash to the environment is associated with the conversion of inorganic Hg to methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative form of Hg that is produced by anaerobic microorganisms. In this study, sediment slurry microcosm experiments were performed to understand how spilled coal ash might influence MeHg production in anaerobic sediments of an aquatic ecosystem. Two coal ash types were used: (1) a weathered coal ash; and (2) a freshly collected, unweathered fly ash that was relatively enriched in sulfate and Hg compared to the weathered ash. These ash samples were added to anaerobic sediment slurries constructed with a relatively pristine sediment (containing 0.03 mg kg-1 Hg) and a Hg-contaminated sediment (containing 0.29 mg kg-1 Hg). The results of these experiments showed negligible net production of MeHg in microcosms with no ash and in microcosms amended with the low sulfate/low Hg ash. In contrast, slurry microcosms amended with high sulfate/high Hg ash showed increases in total MeHg content that was 2 to 3 times greater than control microcosms without ash (p {$<$} 0.001). 16S amplicon sequencing of microbial communities in the slurries indicated that the coal ash addition generally increased the relative abundance of the methylating microbial community, including sulfate-reducing bacteria and iron-reducing bacteria species that are known to be efficient methylators of Hg. The stimulation of these microorganisms was likely caused by the release of substrates (sulfate and Fe) originating from the ash. Overall, the results highlight the need to incorporate both environmental parameters and coal ash characteristics into risk assessments that guide coal ash management and disposal.},

  abstract = {Fly ash (FA), the major by-product of coal-fired thermal power plants, causes significant environmental degradation owing to its injurious heavy metal contents. Leaching of arsenic (As) from ash ponds is especially significant as As released from FA can increase As concentration of drinking water above maximum contaminant level of 10~ppb. The aim of this paper was demonstration of As bioremediation potential of indigenous As resistant bacteria present in the weathered pond ash sample. Ten isolates belonging to Bacillus, Micrococcus, Kytococcus and Staphylococcus genera were characterized. Biochemical tests showed reduction of relatively non toxic arsenate to more toxic arsenite by two strains while four strains showed oxidation of arsenite to arsenate. Two exoplolysaccharide producing strains were shown to absorb As within their biomass. Total heterotrophs versus As resistant heterotrophs counting performed showed that FA was enriched with As resistant heterotrophs. Column leaching based microcosm study revealed overall As detoxification potential of the isolated microbes. \textcopyright{} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},
