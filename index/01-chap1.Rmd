# RESPONSE OF MERCURY METHYLATING BACTERIA TO THE COAL ASH SPILL IN THE DAN RIVER {#pcr}

## Abstract

## Introduction

On February, 2, 2014, two storm water drainage pipes located under a coal ash impoundment pond at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Station near Eden, NC collapsed, releasing approximately 28,000 cubic yards of coal ash and about 27 million gallons of untreated ash wastewater into the Dan River [@dennislemlyDamageCostDan2015]. Following the spill, water and sediment was sampled from the river and Kerr Reservoir downstream of the spill to determine water quality and human health concerns. Test results show no constituents to be at levels exceeding safe limits in the water column [@usepaEPAResponseDuke2014]. Duke Energy dredged ash deposits at two locations along the river, but likely over 90% of the ash remains buried in river sediments or has been deposited into Kerr Lake [@ncdeqRapidResponseTimeline2014].  While the test results are encouraging for immediate water quality, the long-term concern is the effect of mobilization of coal ash constituents into the riverine food webs.

One constituent of particular concern during leaching and/or impoundment failure is mercury.  Mercury, a known neurotoxin and potential endocrine disruptor has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups in proteins where destabilization leads to decreased enzymatic activity and reduced overall fitness [@driscollMercuryGlobalPollutant2013; @ehrlichGeomicrobiologyFifthEdition2008]. In submerged anoxic sediments under certain conditions, inorganic mercury ($\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$) can be converted into MeHg by microbial metabolism [@dashBioremediationPotentialMercury2014; @schaeferActiveTransportSubstrate2011]. Methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in the river food webs, posing a health risk to local residents who consume fish. [@dashBioremediationPotentialMercury2014; @otterTrophicStatusMetal2012; @roweBioaccumulationEffectsMetals2014]. The total available amount of MeHg within an ecosystem is controlled by multiple microbial and abiotic processes that reduce availability of $\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$ or degradation of MeHg. $\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$ can be volatilized as $\mathrm{Hg^{0}}$ through photoreduction or by bacteria with the merA gene [@boydMercuryResistanceOperon2012]. Additionally, MeHg can be demethylated into $\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$ by sunlight [@tsuiPhotodegradationMethylmercuryStream2013] or microbes with the merB gene [@bizilyPhytoremediationMethylmercuryPollution1999]. 

Microorganisms have developed various mechanisms to mitigate effects of high concentrations of heavy metal toxins. These include reduction of the metal to a less toxic form, metal complexation, efflux pumps via an energy-dependent membrane transporter, and extracellular sequestration [@binkleyHeavyMetalsWastewater2003; @poulainCrackingMercuryMethylation2013]. MeHg is produced in anaerobic conditions predominately by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) iron reducing bacteria (IRB) and methanogens [@liuAnalysisMicrobialCommunity2014].  Coal ash may provide the necessary substrates such as sulfates to stimulate the microbial methylation of Hg [@deonarineEnvironmentalImpactsTennessee2013]. 

Two genes are required for methylation of Hg, hgcA and hgcB.  As $\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$ enters the cell, a methylated-HgcA protein transfers a CH3 group to $\mathrm{Hg^{2+}}$ within the cytosol.  HgcB protein is then required to recycle the methylated-HgcA protein [@poulainCrackingMercuryMethylation2013]. The hgcAB sequence is conserved across multiple genera and therefore could be utilized as a molecular biomarker for suspected contaminated sites with real-time quantitative PCR [@christensenDevelopmentValidationBroadRange2016; @dashBioremediationPotentialMercury2014; @limadesilvaHeavyMetalTolerance2012; @parksMechanismHgProtonolysis2009]. Liu et al. (2014) found that the hgcA abundance and the concentration of MeHg in rice paddy soil near the Wanshan Hg mining area was positively correlated [@liuAnalysisMicrobialCommunity2014]. This finding suggests that microbes may be contributing to the MeHg in the sampled soils. They also found high genetic diversity within the microbial community and that environmental factors such as total Hg, $\mathrm{SO_4}$, $\mathrm{NH_4}$, and organic matter influenced the community structure.  After phylogenetic analysis, the representative taxa in the community consisted of Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Euryarchaeota, and two novel taxa [@liuAnalysisMicrobialCommunity2014].

In 2008 a dike failure at the Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash pond in Harriman, Tennessee, released an estimated 5.4 million cubic yards of ash into the surrounding community and rivers [@ruhlEnvironmentalImpactsCoal2010]. The release ruptured a natural gas line, disrupted power and transportation, destroyed three homes, and resulted in the evacuation of nearby neighborhoods. The impoundment pond has since been rebuilt and reinforced to resist natural disasters such as earthquakes [@tvaFactSheetKingston2011]. In sediment samples collected downstream following the spill, total mercury concentrations were three to four times greater than sediments upstream of the spill. MeHg was also slightly higher than upstream [@deonarineEnvironmentalImpactsTennessee2013]. 

The coal ash spill into the Dan River has mobilized heavy metals into the environment. The extent of long-term effects of methylated mercury into the food chain in the river is unknown. Mercury, along with other coal ash constituents may stimulate mercury-methylating microorganisms in anaerobic sediments.  The goal of this study is to determine the overall microbial community response and specifically hgcA abundance as a result of the Dan River coal ash spill. 

### Objective and hypothesis:
Determine spatial distribution of mercury-methylating taxa as a result of the coal ash spill using qPCR. 
I hypothesize that there will be increased abundance of the hgcA genes and therefore, mercury methylating taxa downstream of spill site due to stimulation of sulfate and iron reducing bacteria and methanogens by coal ash constituents present in the sediment. 

## Methods
### Study Sites and Sediment Collection
The Dan River is a 344 km river that rises in Patrick Co. Virginia and crosses into North Carolina in Stokes County. It flows across the border between NC and VA several times before flowing into the Kerr Reservoir on the Roanoke River which then flows to the Atlantic Ocean at the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina. This study encompasses sites upstream of the spill site in Eden, NC and downstream to Milton, NC, a 103 km section of the Dan. 

To characterize the extent of the coal ash spill impact on the microbial community, samples were collected at three upstream reference sites, one site parallel to the ash ponds but upstream of the spill (leaching site), and five downstream sites including near two sites that were dredged for remediation, one at Town Creek, near the spill site and one near Abreu-Grogan Park, Danville, Va., and depositional sites that were not dredged near Danville (Figure \@ref(map)).

Each site was accessed by boat, where sediment from the riverbank and channel was collected. Riverbank sediment cores were collected in triplicate using a piston-style coring device. Channel samples were collected using a small dredge. Sediment cores were segmented by depth and mixed according to one of three sampling schemes to reduce the total number of samples to be assayed. 0.25 $\mathrm{cm^3}$ samples were preserved in CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) for DNA extraction. Channel sediment was mixed thoroughly then 0.25 $\mathrm{cm^3}$ was preserved in CTAB. 

Sampling Scheme: 

A.	Sediment cores extracted in triplicate, each 0-8 cm and 8-16 cm segments sampled

B.	Triplicate sediment cores pooled at 0-2 cm, 10-12 cm, 15-17 cm

C.	Triplicate sediment cores pooled 0-8 cm and 8-16 cm segments sampled.


### DNA extraction and qPCR

A CTAB extraction was performed using standard protocol for each sample (Stewart and Via 1993). The DNA extracted was quantified and subsequently diluted to a standard concentration of 5 ng/L and stored in a 4C refrigerator. Extracted DNA quantity and purity were determined from 2 μl subsamples of each extraction using Thermo Scientific Nanodrop Spectrophotometer based on the 260/280 wavelength ratio. 

An Applied Biosystems StepOne^TM real-time PCR System was utilized to detect, amplify, and quantify target DNA gene proxies and representative taxa to meet the Objective. Primers were chosen from the literature based on targeting a general metabolic category. These include generic primers to the hgcA gene, a sulfate reducing gene, dsr, the 16S rDNA of iron reducing bacteria, and methanogens (Geets et al. 2008, Schaefer et al. 2013, Wagner et al.1998, Wright and Primm 2003, Table X). This approach will define the microbial community abundance encompassed within each sample. Each reaction contained the following: 10µL of Power Sybr® Green PCR master mix, 1µL of forward primer, 1µL of reverse primer, 8µL of sterile deionized water, and 1µL of extracted DNA.  Three negative control reactions, samples repeated in triplicate, and positive standard controls serially diluted in triplicate, were ran in each 48 well plate. The relative abundance of targets were computed by the StepOne software using the generated standard curve. The melt curve was examined to manually ensure that none of the amplifications were due to a false positive.  Statistical analyses including one and two-way ANOVA and regression analyses were performed to determine if a significant difference exists between amounts of targeted DNA collected from sites upstream versus downstream of spill site and within depths of core samples.
