  "PLACEHOLDER Metal tolerance abstract: Coal ash, the residual material of coal combustion for electricity generation, contains heavy metals and other pollutants, is generally deposited into reservoir ponds for storage, although it may spill or leach into nearby water and possibly disrupt aquatic ecological communities. We identified and characterized the metal tolerance of bacteria isolated from a sample of coal ash from a coal ash pond located at the retired Dan River Steam Station in Eden, NC.  SSU rDNA extracted from isolated organisms was sequenced and isolates were predominantly identified as Bacillus and Arthrobacter spp. Isolates were grown in 50% nutrient broth amended with heavy metals commonly found in coal ash waste (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se, Zn), at environmentally relevant concentrations. Growth of coal ash isolates was compared to isolates cultured from coal ash free soil. Overall, isolates exhibited metal tolerance, but so did the soil isolates."
