  Coal ash is the residual material of coal combustion for electricity generation. It contains heavy metals and other pollutants and is generally deposited into reservoir ponds for storage, although it may spill or leach into nearby water and possibly disrupt aquatic ecological communities. In February of 2014, a coal ash spill occurred in the Dan River in Eden, NC. The coal ash contains constituents that may stimulate the growth of mercury methylating bacteria. This study aimed to determine if a microbial response is detected 1.5 years following the spill using qPCR. We tested three primers targeting metabolically distinct groups. We detected an elevated signal 0.5 km from the spill site relative some other upstream and downstream locations. However, highest abundance of SSU rDNA amplified was observed in the furthest upstream site. We also underwent a survey of bacteria present in coal ash ponds where we identified and characterized the metal tolerance of bacteria isolated from a residual coal ash sample from the spilled coal ash pond located at the retired Dan River Steam Station in Eden, NC. SSU rDNA extracted from 31 isolated organisms was sequenced and identified. The population was predominantly composed of *Bacillus* and *Arthrobacter* spp. 14 Isolates were grown in 50% nutrient broth amended with heavy metals commonly found in coal ash waste (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se, Zn) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Growth of coal ash isolates was compared to 2 isolates cultured from coal ash-free soil. Overall, isolates exhibited metal tolerance, but so did the soil isolates.

  Advisor and mentor Dr. Parke Rublee, my committee members, Drs. Anne Hershey and Martin Tsui, ...  The work was supported by a grant awarded by North Carolina Water Resources Research Institute. We thank Brian Williams (Dan River Basin Association) for his help in the field and coordination of sampling. We also acknowledge the field assistance of Kimber Corson, Matthew Monteverde, and Peija Ku for sample collection and processing. dont forget the minions! Very special thanks to Louisa Liberman for her editing and John Rice, and Leah Blasiak for their copious amounts of encouragement and support. I would also like to thank everyone for their patience.
