# Introduction {#intro}

Coal is the second most used fuel for electricity generation in the United States.  In 2017, approximately 30% of all electricity production was fueled by coal combustion [@usenergyinformationadministrationElectricPowerMonthly2019].  Although the percentage has fallen in recent years due to retirement of plants and increase in natural gas and other energy sources, coal remains a main fuel for electricity. During the process of coal combustion, coal combustion residuals, or coal ash, is produced.

Coal combustion residues (CCRs) include fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas desulfurized gypsum.  Fly ash is a fine powdery substance, comprised primarily of silica that is exhausted. It is produced during the combustion of finely ground coal and most is captured from the exhaust using electrostatics and scrubber systems [@usepaFlyAshCoal2014].  Bottom ash is formed during the combustion of pulverized coal in boilers.  It ranges in size from fine sand to fine gravel and is grey to black in color.  Bottom ash is too large to be carried up the exhaust system and is collected in an ash hopper [@usepaBottomAshCoal2014].  Flue gas desulfurized gypsum is not a direct product of coal combustion, but a product of the scrubber system to remove SO^2^ emissions from exhaust [@usepaFlueGasDesulfurization2014]. 

Physical and chemical properties of coal ash are determined by the geographical location where the raw coal was mined, the type of boiler, and the operating conditions of the power plant [@jayaranjanReuseOptionsCoal2014]. Fly ash is composed mainly of oxides such as $\mathrm{SiO_2}$, $\mathrm{Al_2O}$, $\mathrm{Fe_2O}$, $\mathrm{TiO_2}$, and $\mathrm{CaO}$.  All natural elements can be found in coal ash, trace elements include, As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn  [@greelyjr.EffectsSedimentContaining2014; @jayaranjanReuseOptionsCoal2014; @shaheenOpportunitiesChallengesUse2014]. Coal bottom ash consists of silicate, carbonate, aluminate, ferrous materials and several of heavy metals and metalloids. Like fly ash, the chemical composition of the bottom ash is dependent on the source of the raw coal, boiler type, and the refinement process of the raw coal [@jayaranjanReuseOptionsCoal2014]. 

Once produced and collected, CCRs are transported to an impoundment pond or landfill. Impoundment ponds are constructed either lined or unlined; open to the atmosphere or capped. In an open lagoon, the waste settles to the bottom of the pond, presumably, leaving the surface water free of waste. To prevent overflow of these ponds, this shallow water is pumped to an adjacent waterway. In the US, of the approximately 120 Mt of CCRs are produced annually, 54% is disposed of in landfills or surface impoundments [@americancoalashassociation2012CoalCombustion2012]. Possible impoundment failures and leaching allow the mobilization of CCRs including their associated heavy metals into the environment where these metals may enter the food web directly or indirectly through microbially-mediated transformations [@cabralMethylmercuryDegradationPseudomonas2016; @deonarineEnvironmentalImpactsTennessee2013; @otterTrophicStatusMetal2012]. 

On February 2, 2014, two storm water drainage pipes located under a coal ash impoundment pond at the Duke Energy Dan River Steam Station near Eden, NC collapsed, releasing approximately 28,000 cubic yards of coal ash and about 27 million gallons of untreated ash wastewater into the Dan River [@dennislemlyDamageCostDan2015]. Following the spill, water and sediment was sampled from the river and Kerr Reservoir downstream of the spill to assess water quality and human health concerns. Test results show no constituents to be at levels exceeding safe limits in the water column [@usepaEPAResponseDuke2014]. Duke Energy dredged ash deposits at two locations along the river, but likely over 90% of the ash remains buried in river sediments or has been deposited into Kerr Lake [@ncdeqRapidResponseTimeline2014].  While the test results are encouraging for immediate water quality, the long-term concern is the effect of mobilization of coal ash constituents into the riverine food webs.
